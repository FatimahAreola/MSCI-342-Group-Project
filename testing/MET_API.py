""" This document contains unit tests and guidelines for the code found under the pullAPIImages method in the app.py file.
It is likely that future iterations of this code (future sprints) will require reference to multiple documents for this method.
This document will continue to be updated as such.

Instructions to run:
The following tests will need to be run under the method pullMETAPI in the file app.py.
Currently the code runs on a set of ObjectIDs predetermined by the team, the test conditions below are for different 
variations of ObjectIDs.
